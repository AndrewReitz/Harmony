I was tired of having something\r\nthat would play on desktop browsers but not on mobile.  I was tired of having something that would play on both but I would have to install something.\r\nSo when I found jPlayer that would let you play music in web browsers I knew exactly what I wanted to create, a server that I could easily\r\nsetup with a few clicks and could use whereever I have an internet connection.  Right now it works best with Chrome/Mobile Opera, but hopefully\r\nmore browsers will start supporting more media types."}
